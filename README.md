### [Expected Goals Model:](https://github.com/WaydeHerman/Expected_Goals)

An end-to-end football expected goals model. The predictions are the probability of a shot resulting in a goal.

Interesting things about this project include the structure as well as the evaluation of calibration. The code is structured as a pipeline with the code intending to be reusable and modular as opposed to a once off project. Models are tuned using a predefined hyperparameter space stored in dictionaries.

The models are evaluated both by their predictive performance as well as the calibration of their predictions. The latter is evaluated using visual inspection of their calibration curves as opposed to a single metric, which is usually advised.
